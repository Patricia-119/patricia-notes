# PROFLIFHT SYSTEM REVIEW
Proflight Zambia is an airline based in Lusaka, Zambia that serves the business community and tourism industry.  Proflight Zambia operates the largest fleet of aircraft in Zambia, operating both scheduled and charter flights.  Due to stiff competition between airline companies and other technical challenges, proflight would like move digital so that it eases their work flow and data flow within the campoany.

### CHALLENGE PROFLIGHT IS CURRENTLY FACING
- The need of implemeting digital phones lines either for the contact centre only or the whole company.
### GROUND OPERATION DEPARTMENT
- #### FLIGHT OPERATION
under ground operation, it was discovered that staff workers such as ```Womba``` and ```Martin``` who is the station manager talked about how the staff gets overwhelmed with duties and attending to phone calls of which they use different social media networks or media plattforms which includes _whats app_, _telegram_ , _emails_ and other networks either Airtel and MTN etcetera which is sometimes difficult, to keep track of phone calls and messages at the moment. During the conversation we had, it was said that this was the main reason it is difficult to respond to phone calls on time. Which creates a huge barrier to sales, booking hence, loosing customers to other competitors offering the same services in the industry.
- The systems used on the ground operation, **flight operation** specifically is ```Videcom```.
- According to the conversation we had it was said the the _computer hardwares_ and _internet_ are in a good condition except when _installings computer software updates_ for the software being used on their machines of Which, they are not sure if the updates installed are the right ones or not which also takes up part of their work time.
- Their suggestion was that, they think it would be better to have phone line that all customers can use get through to the people on duty at that moment. They suggested that phone line should have some sort of menu where depending on the service the customer want they can be directed to the department that offers it.
### FLIGHT OPERATION DEPARTMENT
- #### FLIGHT DISPATCH
- The flight dispatch - this is where all the main (airline) operations take place. of which they use the management information system. The systems used in the flight operation are as follows; 
 1. Videcom 
 * Which is the reservation system and is used in all departments. It is used for flight-bookings, sales, reports etcetera. Videcom is the main source of all the operations in proflight.
    * The following is an example of a code that is used when a customer wants to generate the capacity of how many people are on a flight.
 ~~~~
 ssrprevflttotal/31052022
 ~~~~
 * The ```rev``` after the ```ssrp``` stands for ```revenue```, the ```flt``` stands for ```flight``` and put the keyword ```total``` and enter the date for the following day then after that, the booking would have been made.
2. Leon
- which is a system that indicates the flight operation. it is used used to prepare the documentation for the next day manually. which consumes alot of time as they are expected not to make errors when entering data.
    - The flight dispatch has the responsbility to also check the movement and errors to make changes if there are any in the reports and sales but this can be done after consulting the maintainance planning team.
    - The maintance planning team is responsible for checking if the aircrafts are working in a good condition and how many cycles does each plane has and they also fix the machines.
    - The maintainance team knows the operation of each and every flight or aircraft.
3. Pilot Planning System (PPS)
-  The purpose of this system is that it generates navigation logs, calculates fuel, weight and blance and it also generates the **Flight Plan**- without a _flight plan_ the aircraft can not take off, so a _flight plan_ is a requirement for an aircraft. 
- This is so, because the flight dispatch officers are supposed to watch the flight and journal log as it takes off and the flight dispatch officers are supposed to know the **reporting time** of when the aircraft took off and the **reporting point**(when the aircraft starts communicating with other towers).
- **NOTE**
    - That the Zambian Air force clears the space in the atmosphere in the case that, the aircraft does not have the clearance number which is enetred in into Leon manually and expires after two weeks,The Zambian Air Force will get rid of the aircraft without question so it is important each aircraft has a clearance number.
### THE CHALLENGE FACED BY THE FLIGHT DISPATCH
 - Communication barrier between the flight dispatch and the commercial department.
### COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT
- Is responsible for bookings of flights, to create schedules, to generate the capacity of the aircraft like stated above using the following code;
```
ssrprevflttotal/31052022

```
- System used  is videcom for generating all the capacities,bookings,sales, creating schedules and sales. Which are then taken to the flight dispatch office or verification and error collecting.
- #### SAFETY DEPARTMENT
    - They modify the data and they deal with aircraft diversion and ensure that everything is okay and safe before usage.
### HANGER (MAINTENANCE TEAM)
- Maintenance team is responsible for fixing aircrafts and therfore,knows the operation and conditions of aircrafts.
- The system used is tortuga - which they use as a login center in their department.
Tortuga is also linked to excel where they prepare their daily schedules and reports which ```Alina```(a staff member)  sends to the manager for verification.
- The system (tortuga) works just fine and it does all the necessary stuff they need digitized. Though there is no electronic book for the tasks given at hand as they have to put a signature in the hardcopy book of each aircraft they are working on or that has to be serviced as it is a requirement that their signatures and stamps are in ink.
- The only challenge they are facing is that the paperwork is too heavy in this department.
- Otherwise this department is reliable to the company as stated by ```Katongo``` the flight dispatch officer.
