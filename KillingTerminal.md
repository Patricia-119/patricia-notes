# KILLING THE RUNNING PORT
- When the server is running in the background and you want to check which process is using the port or the server.
- Type the following command ```ps -ef```  to display the running processes.
- then to kill the running server or port just type the following command ```kill -9 pid``` e.g : kill -9 5430 (pid of the running processes you want to kill).
